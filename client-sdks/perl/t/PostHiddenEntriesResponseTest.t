Direct Freight API

In order to use the Direct Freight API please first contact us to get an API Token. This token needs to be sent as a HTTP header argument in every request to our API.  api-token=\"SECRET KEY\"  Please keep your api-token a secret. If the token is compromised please contact us to get a new one.  This api token authenticates your application and gives it access to the API.  The API token should not be confused with the end-user-token. That token is given to you via the end_user_authentications endpoint when the user logs in. This token is needed in order to use certain features, and get certain sensitive information.  Both Tokens are stateless, and delivered via the HTTP headers.

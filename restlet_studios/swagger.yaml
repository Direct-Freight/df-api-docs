If the token is compromised please contact us to get a new one.\n\nThis api token authenticates your application and gives it access to the API.\n\nThe API token should not be confused with the end-user-token. \nThe end-user-token is given to you via the end_user_authentications endpoint when the user logs in. \nThe end-user-token is needed in order to use certain features, and get certain sensitive information.\n\nBoth Tokens are stateless, and delivered via the HTTP headers.\nThe api token is a permanent token assigned to each partner.\nThe user token is a temporary session token assigned to each direct freight user.\nThe user token can be valid for up to 24 hours depending on activity."

      STAGE=PRIVATE  This field is an additional filter that limits the boards
      response for attributes that are not defined by the load record. Currently
      the following attributes are valid for this field.


      unviewed-loads that have not been viewed by the user (Loads will continue
      to be returned by boards as unviewed until a GET is requested from the
      alerts endpoint.  Requesting the alerts resets the timestamp for
      determining when a load is new to the time of the last search).


      unsent-Loads that have not been sent to or viewed by a user.


      newtag- Loads that are given a new tag.  The new tag is only given to
      loads that are new since the previous search if the 2 searches are both
      done in the same day.

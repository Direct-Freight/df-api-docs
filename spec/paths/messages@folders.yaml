    This returns a list of all folders for this user, along with how many unread
    messages each folder contains. I belive the website's behavior is 0 or 1 per

          You can use any name that has not already been taken. Certain folders
          are automatically created, the first time a message is sent or
          recieved. The names of these folders are reserved and cannot be added,
          modified or deleted.


          Currently they are Active, Pending, Deleted, and Trash.

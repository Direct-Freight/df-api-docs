                    Sent means that the contact sent your user a message, but it
                    has not yet been read by them. Messages are automatically
                    marked as read when the GET /messages endpoint is called for
                    that conversation. This will return null when the contact
                    has not yet sent a message back to your user.

    By default all new contacts end up in Active, or Pending depending on who
    sent a message. Also users are unable to "delete" contacts, but you can
    simulate that using this endpoint to move to Trash.

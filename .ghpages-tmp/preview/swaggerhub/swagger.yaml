    In order to use the Direct Freight API please first contact us to get an API Token. 
    This token needs to be sent as a HTTP header argument in every request to our API.

    api-token="SECRET KEY"

    Please keep your api-token a secret. If the token is compromised please contact us to get a new one.

    This api token authenticates your application and gives it access to the API.

    The API token should not be confused with the end-user-token. 
    The end-user-token is given to you via the end_user_authentications endpoint when the user logs in. 
    The end-user-token is needed in order to use certain features, and get certain sensitive information.

    Both Tokens are stateless, and delivered via the HTTP headers.
